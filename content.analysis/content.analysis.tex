Content analysis is a technique deployed by information architects for helping
them generate a sound and wellstructured website architecture. It consists of
two phases: collection of a representative sample of data and an analysis of
this content. In it's essence a content analysis should indentify the various
relationships (or lack of correlation) between a website's content items.

Instead of using content analysis as a means for improving on an existing
site's content architecture I'll be tailoring this technique to best help me
discover and understand social navigation patterns in infamous websites which
are known to make good use of such navigational designs. This means that I'll
concentrate on only core content objects and relationships amongs them
which are organically generated -- relationships which are made as part of
past users behaviour that can be leveraged by other users as a social form
of navigation.

A high-level mapping of the content and it's various relationships
will be carried out after having performed the low-level content inventory
and the subsequent analysis of these findings.

\section{Flickr}

Flickr is a photo sharing site which are known to be on the cutting edge when
it comes to enabling new and innovating navigational features. This subsequent
analysis of Flickr will be carried out as a registered user. One has to be
registered for interacting with the site in such a way that one leaves
persistent traces even though all content is available and open for all users.

One can follow several navigational paths for ending up on some of the pages
identified below. In my first navigation upon a given page I've followed all
relevant navigational paths to the end. On my second encounter of the same
page I've noted the identifier for the first time this page was visited.

The following content inventory detailed in
Table~\ref{table:flickr.content.inventory.1}
(p.~\pageref{table:flickr.content.inventory.1}),
Table~\ref{table:flickr.content.inventory.2}
(p.~\pageref{table:flickr.content.inventory.2}), and
Table~\ref{table:flickr.content.inventory.3}
(p.~\pageref{table:flickr.content.inventory.3})
represents the state of the Flickr service as of the 20th September 2007.
Details could very well have changed since then as
services like these are known to have a rapid development cycle
where changes and improvments often are imposed on the userbase at quite
a frequent rate.

When collecting data one notices that there is an enormous ammount of pages
sharing a common structure only differing in a variable. Examples include
the user in question for a profile page, the tag for a listing of photos
annotated with such a tag, the date for time based history listings and so on.
I therefore introduced several such variables prefixed with a dollar sign: \$
\footnote{Inspired from variable usage in UNIX shell scripting}. A complete
listing of such variables an their meaning can be found in
Table~\ref{table:flickr.variable.list}
(p.~\pageref{table:flickr.variable.list})

Most pages have both a title displayed in the browsers title-bar (using a
html title anchor inside the head anchor) and a in page-heading (usualy inside
a html h1 anchor). During the content inventory I took not of the most
descriptive of these two in the following ``Page Title'' columns. There were
occasions where one of these were lacking in properly describing the pages
content. Since the aim of this content inventory is to get an informed picture
of the navigational structures I simply selected the most fitting title.
I opted to ignore noting down such inconsistencies as one probably would to
when using content inventory as a tool for improving site architecture.

In addition to the ``Page Title'' column the content inventory tables have an
``Id'' column where each page is assigned a unique identifier of hierarchical
nature, a ``Link Name'' column describing the text of the link
