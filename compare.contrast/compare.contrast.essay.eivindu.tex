\title{INF5550 -- Master Essay}

\begin{document}

\maketitle{}

The aim of this essay is to compare and contrast two papers in the field of
social navigation in the context of the web. First there will be summaries
of the papers, highligting what I think are the most important aspects.
Then I'll compare the complementary aspects and contrast the contradictory
features of these two articles. Lastly I'll discuss my personal
oppinions of the subject and how it all relates to the state of the modern web
infamously known as ``Web 2.0'' and finally come to a conclusion.

I decided to review two of the most cited papers in this field. While both of
them are nearly a decade old they both have important insights which could be
just as valid today as when they were written.
